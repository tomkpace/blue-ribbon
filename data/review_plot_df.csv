m/top_gun,"Top Gun is the type of movie that turns the screen into an altar. Kneeling before its slick façade of 1980s magnificence, you are in the shadow of a film that has defined the modern day action blockbuster."
m/top_gun,The dogfights are absolutely the best since Clint Eastwood's electrifying aerial scenes in Firefox. But look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another.
m/top_gun,"Every time I see it, I just want to smash Tom Cruise's smug, arrogant face into the cockpit windshield."
m/top_gun,Focuses on the machismo posturing of elite flyboys and the joys of male camaraderie.
m/top_gun,The only thing that got me through the movie was the hilariously dumb and macho rivalry between Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise.
m/top_gun,"I feel the need, the need.....to experience it all again!"
m/top_gun,"Loud, silly, stylistic, but carried by Cruise's charisma."
m/top_gun,"Jet piloting is the ultimate gesture not of national defense but of personal style, as if the planes were the ultimate, unfeminizing fashion accessory."
m/top_gun,Everything wrong with 80s movies in one film.
m/top_gun,"Once 'Top Gun... gets back to earth, the master of the skies is as clunky as a big land-bound bird."
m/top_gun,thrilling but far too rah-rah
m/top_gun,today its legacy is more of a punchline as an analogy for '80s overindulgence in action films and as a vehicle to be freely reinterpreted
m/top_gun,Not exactly a cinema classic but it has not only become a cultural icon but remains infinitely rewatchable.
m/top_gun,"The story is risible, the direction routine, the underlying ethic highly questionable; but the flying stirs the blood like speed."
m/top_gun,"Noisy, slick, and shallow, Tony Scott's MTV-like actioner became emblematic of 1980s blockbusters, reflecting in its macho bravado and cheap elitism the mood of the Reagan era; in the process, it also made Tom Cruise the biggest star of his generation"
m/top_gun,This movie gets worse with time.
m/top_gun,"You get about thirty minutes of good movie in Top Gun, and most of that comes at the end."
m/top_gun,"A movie for adolescents, and adults who willfully decide not to know better for a couple of hours. [Blu-Ray]"
m/top_gun,(Its success) supports the pop-psych analysis that pre-actualized teenage boys are the most homosexual beings in existence.
m/top_gun,"Like many films from its decade, Top Gun is steeped in 80s culture %u2013 from the top 40 music to the clothing styles."
m/top_gun,Watchable but rarely enthralling...
m/top_gun,"Set in the world of naval fighter pilots, pic has strong visuals and pretty young people in stylish clothes and a non-stop soundtrack."
m/top_gun,Tom Cruise classic still revs engines.
m/top_gun,"Top Gun is about the training of the Navy's best fighter pilots and their blooding in cold war incidents, and the only thing Director Tony Scott has not brought up to date is the story."
m/top_gun,This paean to hotshot Navy fighter pilots and high technology attracted mass audiences despite its familiar plot and characters so vapid they vanish from memory as soon as the house lights come up.
m/top_gun,"Every moment is hyped for maximum visual and visceral impact, but Scott doesn't display the slightest bit of interest (or belief) in the actual characters and situations."
m/top_gun,"Among the first generation of films influenced by the cutting techniques of music videos, a progression of oversaturated, meaty images, embarrassing dialogue and awful music."
m/top_gun,"Whether you love Top Gun or hate it -- or hate yourself for loving it -- the fact is that when it became the top-grossing film of 1986, Hollywood in its infinite wisdom took all of the worst lessons from its success and overlooked what made it so... fun."
m/top_gun,"Basically perfect, even it is perfect at one of the worst sorts of things a movie can attempt."
m/top_gun,Watching Top Gun again twenty five years after its release is still a dazzling and dizzying experience. You are not so much on the edge of your seat as flung around it as the on-screen action endlessly spins and soars.
m/top_gun,The aerial sequences in Top Gun are as thrilling -- while remaining coherent -- as any ever put on film.
m/top_gun,"There are elements that hold up - especially Cruise's blinding charisma. The aerial scenes are still thrilling, and perfectly suited to a giant screen. Everything else? Well, that depends on how nostalgic you're feeling."
m/top_gun,"It's still the same old Top Gun, retaining every frame of ridiculousness and emphatic acting that turned the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer production into a legend."
m/top_gun,"The 3D is impressive considering it wasn't shot for that, and the sound delivers full throttle engine roars and the legendary soundtrack sounds as crisp as ever."
m/top_gun,"If you missed it in theaters the first time, it's probably going to be the best movie theater experience you'll have so far this year."
m/top_gun,"An undeniably cheesy yet strangely appealing time capsule, with a little something for everyone provided we understand that it's all bubblegum."
m/top_gun,"The unashamedly goofy 1986 dogfighting classic flips on the afterburners to make yet another pass on Blu-ray, this time soaring into the third dimension."
m/top_gun,"You can argue that it's a cool movie, but is ""Top Gun"" a good movie? I'd definitely say ""Hell no,"" topped with ""Are you kidding me?"""
m/top_gun,"Cruise, the cheesy soundtrack and the stunning aerial photography that marks out its combat scenes are its three main selling points."
m/top_gun,"""Top Gun"" works best as a sort of time capsule, a window into a pretty spectacular decade for big-budget filmmaking."
m/top_gun,"Slickly made, it's a fairly entertaining watch that doesn't provide much beyond surface thrills, although many have had fun analyzing its (unintentional?) homoerotic content."
m/top_gun,Could Top Gun actually be a portrait of the dark side of American individualism?
m/top_gun,"The movie, in short, hits its emotional marks, but it does so with such insistence that it feels less like real life than an object lesson in the architecture of the blockbuster."
m/top_gun,"... ""Top Gun"" is terribly monotonous."
m/top_gun,"The film's intensity mirrors the competitive and wild personalities of the pilots themselves. In this arena, the casting is on-target."
m/top_gun,"Tony Scott brought some incredible shots to the film, mounting cameras everywhere on the fighter jets to achieve amazing footage while giving the audience the feeling they were flying right alongside Maverick."
m/top_gun,"Rick Martin returns home to Casper, Wyoming, where he is unwanted because of his reputation as a gunslinger. He does have a few friends in town, including Marshal Bat Davis and hotel owner Jim O'Hara.
As Rick visits his mother's grave, he notices a marker beside hers with his name on it; there is also an open grave, ready for him. Bat arrives and Rick informs him that an outlaw they have both ridden with in the past, Tom Quentin, and his gang of fifteen men are on the way to take what they want from Casper. Bat tells the town council this and tries to rustle up a posse. In spite of Rick wanting to stay and help, the officials insist he leave town by midnight.
Rick rides to former sweetheart Laura Mead's ranch to ask her to marry him and move to California, but she is engaged to a wealthy council member, Canby Judd.
Rick learns his mother was cheated out of her ranch by Judd and murdered by him. After a fistfight, Judd hires gunfighter Lem Sutter to ambush Rick, but when Sutter ends up dead, and Judd lies about how it happened, Bat has no choice but to place Rick under arrest. Bat tries to head off Quentin on the trail, but is shot. Townspeople now beg Rick for help. He is able to kill Quentin in a fair fight, and Laura kills Judd when he is about to shoot Rick in the back. Rick and Laura pack up and leave for California."
m/top_gun,"United States Naval Aviator LT Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell and his Radar Intercept Officer LT(jg) Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw fly the F-14A Tomcat aboard USS Enterprise (CVN-65). During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by a Northrop F-5), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his wings, citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, CAG ""Stinger"" sends him and Goose to attend the Top Gun school at NAS Miramar.
At a bar the day before Top Gun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. He learns the next day that she is Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood, an astrophysicist and civilian Top Gun instructor. She becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.
During Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor Rick ""Jester"" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two rules of engagement and is reprimanded by chief instructor Mike ""Viper"" Metcalf. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's flying ""dangerous."" Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics, but eventually admits that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.
During a training sortie Maverick abandons his wingman ""Hollywood"" to chase Viper, but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess.
Maverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Top Gun Trophy, chase Jester in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot down Jester, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, going into an unrecoverable flat spin. Maverick and Goose eject, but Goose hits the jettisoned aircraft canopy head-first and is killed.
Although the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on the USS Oriskany. Mitchell was subject to an unspecified disgrace, which has hampered Maverick's career and self-confidence, but Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically, and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.
During the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to Enterprise to deal with a ""crisis situation"", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.
Maverick and Merlin are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, Maverick shoots down three MiGs, and Iceman one, forcing the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to Enterprise, Iceman and Maverick express a newfound respect for each other.
Offered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Top Gun as an instructor. At a bar at Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite."
